                                 use all the available cores for the 
                                 computations. The routines 
                                 PrepareParallelization and

                                 provided the generator is provided. This is 
                                 justified by the fact that before the 
                                 dynkin index was set to 1/2 for any 
                                 representation which is not true.

1646 1.7.116 16-01-13 aalloul:    When the operator CC is put in the 
                                 lagrangian, its definitions are such that 
                                 ExpandIndices doesn't work well. So needed 
                                 a special treatment just before starting 
                                 lagrangian expansion.

                                 interface, more precision digits and 
                                 possible to write the interface for only 
                                 some of the mixings.

                                 <input file> <output file> The log file is 
                                 created automatically. 

1618 1.7.109 12-12-12 aalloul:    The AspergeInterface would have crashed if 
                                 one used the option Output awith tas a 
                                 value a non-string. Fixed. 

1609 1.7.108 11-12-12 aalloul:    changed bc/BoundaryConditions.dat to

                                 WriteAsperge[lagrangian,options] to have 
                                 the c++ code. It can be run from any 
                                 directory provided the $FeynRulesPath is 
                                 defined. 

1600 1.7.105 07-12-12 aalloul:    Changed the mass diagonalization interface 
                                 so that the user can run it from any 
                                 directory provided that $FeynRulesPath is 
                                 defined. Changed also the output of the c++ 
                                 code so that ReadLHAFile[] doesn't crash.

                                 NumericalValue and Factor was added) 

1278 1.7.22 30-05-12 claudeduhr: fixed bug in the multi fermions, related 
                                 to1234 = 3412. Introduced CanonicalizeFlow[ 
                                 ] function. 

1277 1.7.21 29-05-12 bfuks:      Bug fixed in the decay package 

1275 1.7.20 28-05-12 bfuks:      issues with previous commitments 

1274 1.7.19 26-05-12 claudeduhr: Mass[ ] is now working after restrictions. 
                                 Change in GetMass[ ]. 

1273 1.7.18 26-05-12 bfuks:      decay package updated 

1268 1.7.17 25-05-12 aalloul:    Small bug fixed in SpecialExpandIndices and 
                                 FieldCount. For the first one, a wrong 
                                 output was produced if expression 'tmplag' 
                                 contained only 1 term. FieldCount wused to 
                                 return the number 1 if applied on the 
                                 expression Dot[field1, field2] -> 
                                 corrected. 

1263 1.7.16 24-05-12 cdegrand:   Retest new four-fermion in FA, few bug 
                                 fixed 

1251 1.7.15 24-05-12 bfuks:      Improvement of the decay package 

1237 1.7.14 21-05-12 neil:       Set FeynmanGauge=True for SM.fr as default. 

1227 1.7.13 18-05-12 neil:       Fixed a couple of typos in CH interface. 

1220 1.7.12 16-05-12 claudeduhr: fix in VertexRoutine.m (needed to add a 
                                 Return to avoid 0 passed to Unitarity 
                                 checks) and in the MG4 interface (ME[_,_] 
                                 evaluating to 4) 

1218 1.7.11 16-05-12 neil:       Fixed Eps bug in CH interface. 

1214 1.7.10 16-05-12 bfuks:      new version of the standard model 

1198 1.7.9 14-05-12 bfuks:       Mass diagonalization: extraction of the 
                                 non-rotated mass lagrangian 

1197 1.7.8 13-05-12 claudeduhr:  Added multifermion routines for UFO 

1192 1.7.7 10-05-12 aalloul:     Added one line in the YukawaRGEs, 
                                 BilinearRGEs and LinearRGEs to Allow for a 
                                 direct usage without calling 
                                 ExtractSuperWTerms before 

1191 1.7.6 10-05-12 aalloul:     Added three functions into InSuRGE: 
                                 YukawaRGEs, BilinearRGEs and LinearRGEs. 
                                 These new functions allow to access 
                                 directly the subsets of RGEs in 
                                 SuperpotentialRGEs. 

1190 1.7.5 08-05-12 bfuks:       The decay package now handles abbreviations 
                                 correctly 

1184 1.7.4 02-05-12 claudeduhr:  Added PYDecays.py

1182 1.7.2 02-05-12 bfuks:       decay package improved; commit script added;
                                 versioning system added
